Build Instructions
-------------------

To build the MRIphantom application using PyInstaller and an app.spec configuration file, follow these steps:

Install PyInstaller:
If you haven't already installed PyInstaller, you can do so via pip by running the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pyinstaller

Use the app.spec Configuration File located in the rood directory of the project:
The app.spec file is used by PyInstaller to specify how the application should be bundled.

Run PyInstaller:
Once you have checked the app.spec file, you can use PyInstaller to build the application by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pyinstaller app.spec

Locate the Executable:
After PyInstaller completes the build process, you can find the executable file in the dist directory within the project folder.
The exact location may vary depending on your operating system and the configuration specified in app.spec.

Test the Application:
Before using the application, it's a good idea to test it to ensure that it functions correctly.
Run the executable file generated by PyInstaller to verify that the application works as expected.


Debugging
----------

A special Debug Mode is enabled by exporting system variable DEBUG=2:

.. code-block:: console

    $ export DEBUG=2

Debug Mode disables splash screen and other excessive functionality.
